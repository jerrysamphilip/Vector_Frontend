# app/prompts/email_examples.py
"""
Few-shot email examples for LLM-guided generation.

Examples are stored per persona_type and industry_tag.
The get_few_shot_examples_block() function returns a formatted prompt block
injected into the user_prompt in ai_email_service.py and sequence_generator.py.

Signatures and unsubscribe footers are stripped from examples — the system's
finalize_email_body() appends the standard footer and {{your_name}} token
automatically to every generated email, so including them here would duplicate them.

To add more examples: add a new dict to EMAIL_EXAMPLES[persona_type].
No changes needed in service files or prompt functions.
