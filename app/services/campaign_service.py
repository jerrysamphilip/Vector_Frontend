"""
Backward-compatible re-export shim.

The original CampaignService has been split into three focused services:
  - CampaignCRUDService     → campaign_crud_service.py
  - CampaignEmailService    → campaign_email_service.py
  - CampaignAnalyticsService→ campaign_analytics_service.py

This module re-exports CampaignService as a thin composite that inherits from
all three services so that any existing callers importing CampaignService
continue to work without changes.
